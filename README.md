# 🧠 CodexAI

CodexAI is a decentralized, AI-enhanced competitive coding platform that rewards developers based on skill, performance, and fairness. Combining blockchain, smart contracts, and AI, CodexAI aims to transform how coding contests are conducted and incentivized.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Decentralized Problem Solving**  
  Users create contests by staking CodexCoin (CDX), and participants also stake a portion to compete. Rewards are distributed based on well-defined criteria after 24 hours of contest end.

- **AI-Powered Evaluation**  
  Code is evaluated not only for correctness but also for efficiency, elegance, and time taken — all with the help of AI agents.

- **Trustless Reward System**  
  Funds are held in Stellar smart contracts and released after ranking finalization, ensuring transparency.

- **Secure & Fair Contests**  
  Anti-cheating mechanisms include:
  - Tab switch detection  
  - Time-limited code editors  
  - AI and user-based post-contest flagging

## 📈 Why CodexAI Will Boom

With AI evolving to deeply analyze code — beyond syntax and correctness — CodexAI offers a future-proof system that:
- Understands code intent, complexity, and originality
- Uses models to detect plagiarism with context
- Can scale code reviews autonomously

As AI becomes more powerful, decentralized platforms like CodexAI will lead the way in merit-based, trustless coding evaluations.
